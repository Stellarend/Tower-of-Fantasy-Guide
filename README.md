## Overview

The optimal way to progress in this game is to select the 3 SSR characters (aka weapons) you want to play, find the best SSR matricies (4 for each) for those characters, and hoard all your resources for leveling up your 3 characters and 12 matrices.

## Getting Started

### Choosing a Simulacrum/Character/Weapon

Simulacrums, characters, and weapons are the same thing, so for the purpose of this guide, I will refer to them as characters.

When choosing a character, there are a few things you should take into account:

1. Enjoyment

    If you don't enjoy your characters then you'll never want to play, so you'll never make progress. The most important thing is that you enjoy your character to keep you motivated to grind for progression.    

1. Team Requirements

    If you play with other people, consider chosing a role that compliments their playstyle. In most MMORPGs a team of 4 DPS might technically be the best for clearing efficiency, but unless you're a whale and have the best gear, it's likely that your party will wipe many times for harder content. Playing supports or tanks might give your party a higher chance of success.

1. Resonance

    Characters are catagorized into 3 roles; tank, support, and DPS. Choosing a combination of character these roles will provide bonuses. This is known as Resonance and it will allow you to further specialize what kind of playstyle you want to have, especially in a team setting.

1. Tier List (PvP vs PvE)

    Unfortunately, ToF is not a perfectly balanced game so some characters are stronger than others, though all of them are good enough for end game content with enough resources. If you want to be the best, I suggest looking at character tier lists which I will not cover in this guide as it will be constantly changing between patches.

# TODO: other notes I've made that I need to organize into this guide

General notes:
1. do NOT open supply pods
    - black or gold spherical chests
    - they scale with lvl, don't open till endgame
2. Save blue and purple ciphers till Area 2 (Vera) opens up as it has better rewards
3. Only do spend gold cipher for world boss for character chips you want (check map for boss drop)
    - you can still kill other bosses for achievements or tasks, but don't open the chest
2. when nearby unlock:
    - spacerifts
    - onmium towers
    - sceneic points
    - world exploration marks
3. unlock food recipes via cooking (lookup recipes)
4. do achievements when time restricted tasks are done
5. use black crystals on red orbs
    - use on limited characters if you want a specific one
    - otherwise use all on limited weapons
6. unless it's for a daily/weekly, don't do joint operations till 06 (lvl 50), SSR gear only starts dropping then
7. don't buy blue gear, it drops from dungeons (joint operation)
8. hoard purple and gold orbs
9. spend energy on interstellar exploration and dimension trials, whichever gives better rewards
10. upgrade gear, starting with weapons, boots, then gloves, in increments of 5
11. if gear upgrade materials are limited in shop, buy it whenever it refreshes in shop
12. don't waste SR (purple) materials on upgrading weapons below SSR (yellow)
12. upgrade weapons above all else in this order:
    - single target dps
    - AOE dps
    - ranged dps
    - healing
13. Do NOT use red orbs unless you have 120 saved up. This is so you can use the red tokens to guarantee buy something. If you don't get 120 tokens and buy a weapon, they eventually turn into gold tokens.
14. Upgrade Mind matrix first because it grants crit which is the best stat

Time restricted tasks:
1. MSQ up to limit, indicated by the yellow exclamation mark
2. side quest
3. lvl 15
4. daily bounties
5. ruins
6. force open repeatable chests (pyramid and rectangular chests), don't spend ciphers
7. lvl 18
8. ability training
9. weeklies
10. black market / hopkins secret box
11. CETUS arcade claw fox
