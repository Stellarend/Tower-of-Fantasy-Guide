## Overview

The optimal way to progress in this game is to choose the 3 SSR weapons you want to use, research the best SSR matrices for those weapons (4 each), hoard all your resources for leveling up your 3 weapons and 12 matrices, gacha pull until you have your ideal setup. This guide will help you choose your weapons + matrices and provide time-optimal methods to get pulls and resources for making them more powerful.

## Getting Started

### Choosing a Simulacrum/Character/Weapon

Simulacrums, characters, and weapons are the same thing, so for the purpose of this guide, I will refer to them as weapons.

| Simulacrum | Weapon | Class | Element | Type |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Claudia | Red Lotus Blade | Attack | Physical | Sword |
| Shiro | Ring of the SeaBlade | Attack | Physical | Chakram |
| Cobalt-B | Blazing Revolver | Attack | Fire | Gun (Shotgun) |
| King | Black Crow Scythe | Attack | Fire | Scythe |
| Tsubasa (Hane) | Ice-Wind Arrow | Attack | Ice | Bow |
| Crow (Karasuma) | Lightning Blades | Attack | Lightning | Dagger |
| Samir (Semir) | Super Electromagnetic Double Star | Attack | Lightning | Gun (Dual Pistols) |
| Meryl | Rosy Edge | Defense | Ice | Greatsword |
| Huma (Schumer) | Melt-Down Shield V2 | Defense | Fire | Sheild/Axe |
| Cocoritter | Absolute Zero Scepter | Support | Ice | Scepter |
| Zero (Rei) | Veto Cube | Support | Fire | Cube |

When choosing a weapon, there are a few things you should take into account:

1. Enjoyment

    If you don't enjoy your weapons then you'll never want to play, so you'll never make progress. The most important thing is that you enjoy your weapon to keep you motivated to grind for progression.    

1. Team Requirements

    If you play with other people, consider choosing weapon classes that compliment their playstyle. In most MMORPGs a team of 4 attackers might technically be the best for clearing efficiency, but unless you're a whale and have the best gear, it's likely that your party will wipe many times in harder content. Playing as a support or tank might give your party a higher chance of success.

1. Resonance

    Weapons are categorized into 3 classes; tank, support, and attack. Choosing a combination these classes will provide bonuses. This is known as Resonance and it will allow you to further specialize what kind of playstyle you want to have, especially in a team setting. Choosing a neutral/balanced resonance generally has fewer bonuses.

1. Element

    Elements provide debuffs to enemies when they are hit, however these debuffs do not stack, they only refresh. As a result, it is ideal to have a variety of elements within your party to apply as many elemental debuffs as possible

1. Tier List (PvP vs PvE)

    ToF is not a perfectly balanced game so some weapons are stronger than others, though all of them are good enough for end game content with enough resources. If you want to be the best, I suggest looking at weapon tier lists which I will not cover in this guide as it will be constantly changing between patches.

## Optimal Resource Usage

As a free to play, your resources are limited, so it's important you min-max them for maximum progression. Here are the limited resources you have access to and the optimal ways to use them.

- Black Crystals
    - Usable in the shop
    - Purchase limited nucleus (red orb)
- Vitality / Energy
    - Used for Adventure Select and refreshes slowly overtime
    - Do not allow it to cap, always make sure it's under 100 at the end of a play session
    - Do Interstellar Exploration and Dimension Trials as it has the best rewards till level 50
    - Once level 50, do Joint Operations 06, SSR gear only starts dropping then
- Blue and Purple Cipher
    - Used to open respawnable chests (pyramid and rectangular chests) for better rewards
    - Save for Area 2 (Vera, desert and floating pyramid city, which releases on patch 2.0), as chests will start dropping SR gear then
    - You can still open respawnable chests, but make sure to FORCE open the chest so you don't use your ciphers
- Gold Cipher
    - Used to open world boss chests for better rewards
    - Save for the matrices you want (check map for boss drop)
    - you can still kill other bosses for achievements or tasks, but make sure to FORCE open the chest so you don't use the gold cipher
- Supply Pods
    - Black/purple or gold spherical chests that have very good rewards and XP
    - These are one time use and do not respawn
    - The rewards scale with your level, so don't open till level 50 which is when you can get SSR gear
- Personal Chef
    - Provides free resources every 6 hours
    - Do not allow it to sit at 3/3
- Black and Gold Nucleus (black and gold orbs)
    - Used to pull weapons from the permanent weapon banner
    - If the weapon you're looking for is not in the permanent banner (pool), save up these nuclei
        - Every few months, a weapon from the limited banner is moved into the permanent banner so you can wait till then
    - Otherwise, you can spend these as soon as you get them
    - Each gold pull gives you a Gold Token
- Red Nucleus (red orb)
    - Used to pull weapons from the limited weapon banner
    - Save and spend in batches of 120 (see Red Token)
    - Each red pull gives you a Red Token
- Proof of Purchase (gold chip)
    - Used to pull matrices from the permanent matrix banner
    - If the matrix you're looking for is not in the permanent banner (pool), save up these Proofs of Purchase
        - Every few months, a matrix from the limited banner is moved into the permanent banner so you can wait till then
    - Each pull gives you a Gold Token
- Special Voucher (red chip)
    - Used to pull matrices from the limited matrix banner
    - Save and spend in batches of 120 (see Red Token)
    - Each red pull gives you a Red Token
- Gold Token
    - Used to buy a duplicate SSR weapon for 120 gold tokens
    - This means you must already own the SSR weapon
    - Save for the 3 weapons you've chosen, especially the ones that are not good in their base form (0 star)
- Red Token
    - Used to buy the limited SSR weapon in limited banner for 120 red tokens
    - When the limited banner rotates to a new limited SSR weapon (once a week?) any unspent Red Tokens will be downgraded to Gold Tokens
        - This is why you should only use Red Nucleus in batches of 120
    - Every account can also buy 1 Matrix Box for 50 Red Tokens
        - This will allow you to choose any matrix
            - It's recommend you spend all your Proofs of Purchase and Special Vouchers before doing this so you get one you don't already have

# TODO: other notes I've made that I need to organize into this guide

General notes:
1. Don't upgrading individual gear pieces unless its SSR. You should, however upgrade the gear slots as it will keep the upgrades even if you upgrade your gear
1. Upgrade your gear in increments of 5 to get milestone bonuses, starting with gloves and boots
1. if gear upgrade materials are limited in shop, buy it whenever it refreshes in shop
1. when nearby unlock:
    - spacerifts
    - onmium towers
    - scenic points
    - world exploration marks
1. unlock food recipes via cooking (lookup recipes)
1. do achievements when time restricted tasks are done
1. don't buy blue gear, it drops from dungeons (joint operation)
1. don't waste SR (purple) materials on upgrading weapons below SSR (yellow)
1. upgrade weapons above all else in this order:
    - single target dps
    - AOE dps
    - ranged dps
    - healing
1. Do NOT use red orbs unless you have 120 saved up. This is so you can use the red tokens to guarantee buy something. If you don't get 120 tokens and buy a weapon, they eventually turn into gold tokens.
1. Upgrade Mind matrix first because it grants crit which is the best stat
