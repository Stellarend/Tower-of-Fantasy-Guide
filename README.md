## Overview

The optimal way to progress in this game is to choose the 2-3 SSR weapons you want to use, research the best SSR matrices for those weapons (4 each), hoard all your resources for leveling up your weapons and matrices, then gacha pull until you have your ideal setup. This guide will help you choose your weapons + matrices and provide time-optimal methods to get pulls and resources for making them more powerful.

## Getting Started

### Choosing a Simulacrum/Character/Weapon

Simulacrums, characters, and weapons are the same thing, so for the purpose of this guide, I will refer to them as weapons.

| Simulacrum | Weapon | Class | Element | Type |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Claudia | Red Lotus Blade | Attack | Physical | Sword |
| Shiro | Ring of the SeaBlade | Attack | Physical | Chakram |
| Cobalt-B | Blazing Revolver | Attack | Fire | Gun (Shotgun) |
| King | Black Crow Scythe | Attack | Fire | Scythe |
| Tsubasa (Hane) | Ice-Wind Arrow | Attack | Ice | Bow |
| Crow (Karasuma) | Lightning Blades | Attack | Lightning | Dagger |
| Samir (Semir) | Super Electromagnetic Double Star | Attack | Lightning | Gun (Dual Pistols) |
| Meryl | Rosy Edge | Defense | Ice | Greatsword |
| Huma (Schumer) | Melt-Down Shield V2 | Defense | Fire | Sheild/Axe |
| Cocoritter | Absolute Zero Scepter | Support | Ice | Scepter |
| Zero (Rei) | Veto Cube | Support | Fire | Cube |

When choosing a weapon, there are a few things you should take into account:

1. Enjoyment

    If you don't enjoy your weapons then you'll never want to play, so you'll never make progress. The most important thing is that you enjoy your weapon so you stay motivated to grind for progression.    

1. Shatter and Charge Rate

    ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19635286/183938038-50da0994-7a45-4dbc-bbbd-05ce1f2de5b6.png)

    Shatter is the value on the left, and Charge Rate is the value on the right. Stronger enemies will have a powerful shield that is very difficult to destroy if you don't have any weapons with high shatter (10+). As such, it's important to have atleast one weapon that can shatter enemy shields. Charge Rate affects how often you can use your discharge ability, and although it is important, it isn't as necessary as shatter. Ideally you would have atleast one weapon with high Shatter and one with high Charge Rate. Some weapons have both high Shatter and Charge Rate.

1. Team Requirements

    If you play with other people, consider choosing weapon classes that compliment their playstyle. In most MMORPGs a team of 4 attackers might technically be the best for clearing efficiency, but unless you're a whale and have the best gear, it's likely that your party will wipe many times in harder content. Playing as a support or tank might give your party a higher chance of success.

1. Resonance

    Weapons are categorized into 3 classes; tank, support, and attack. Choosing a combination these classes will provide bonuses. This is known as Resonance and it will allow you to further specialize what kind of playstyle you want to have, especially in a team setting. Choosing a neutral/balanced resonance generally has fewer bonuses.

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19635286/183746466-0ee5d3b3-bef4-42ce-bede-3cb684548311.png)

1. Element

    Elements provide debuffs to enemies when they are hit, however these debuffs do not stack, they only refresh. As a result, it is ideal to have a variety of elements within your party to apply as many elemental debuffs as possible

1. Tier List (PvP vs PvE)

    ToF is not a perfectly balanced game so some weapons are stronger than others, though all of them are good enough for end game content with enough resources. If you want to be the best, I suggest looking at weapon tier lists which I will not cover in this guide as it will be constantly changing between patches.

### Day-One Guide

This serves as a day-one guide, but is also applicable as a checklist that you can perform every day. It should take ~2 hours to complete.

1. Main story quest up to the limit, indicated by the yellow exclamation mark
1. Level 15
1. Daily bounties
1. Ruins
1. Level 18 (level cap)
1. Ability training (purchase special gift with training points)
1. Black market / Hopkin's secret box
1. Cetus island arcade claw fox (this is quite hard to get to, don't worry about it unless you're up for a challenge)

Along the way you should also be doing the following if its nearby:

- Force open repeatable chests (pyramid and rectangular chests), don't spend ciphers
- Pickup any loot
- Map completion:
    - Side Quests
    - Spacerifts
    - Onmium Towers
    - Scenic Points
    - World Exploration Marks

## Optimal Resource Usage

As a free to play, your resources are limited, so it's important you min-max them for optimal progression. Here are the limited resources you have access to, and the best ways to use them.

- Supply Pods
    - Black/purple or gold spherical chests that have very good rewards and XP
    - These are one time use and do not respawn
    - The rewards scale with your level, so don't open till level 50 which is when you can get SSR gear
    - Once you do hit level 50, sign into [ToF map tracker](https://tower-of-fantasy-map.appsample.com) to track which supply pods you've opened
        - Not doing so will be VERY painful
- Inventory Boxes
    - This includes Elemental ore shard, Matrix, and Weapon augmentation boxes
    - These let you choose which reward you want
    - Do NOT open these until you need them as they will clutter your inventory, and you won't know which one to choose until you're missing resources
- Potent Omnium Crystal
    - Used to upgrade your Suppressor
    - Upgrade your Suppressor whenever possible
- Black Crystals
    - Usable in the shop
    - Purchase Red Nucleus
    - Once your 3 weapons are max stars, purchase Special Voucher instead
- Vitality / Energy
    - Used for Adventure Select and refreshes slowly overtime
    - Do not allow it to cap, always make sure it's under 100 at the end of a play session
    - Do Interstellar Exploration and Dimension Trials as it has the best rewards till level 50
    - Once level 50, do Joint Operations 06, SSR gear only starts dropping then
- Blue and Purple Cipher
    - Used to open respawnable chests (pyramid and rectangular chests) for better rewards
    - Save for Area 2 (Vera, desert and floating pyramid city, which releases on patch 2.0), as chests will start dropping SR gear then
    - You can still open respawnable chests, but make sure to FORCE open the chest so you don't use your ciphers
- Gold Cipher
    - Used to open world boss chests for better rewards
    - Save for the matrices you want (check map for boss drop)
    - You can still kill other bosses for achievements or tasks, but make sure to FORCE open the chest so you don't use the gold cipher
- Personal Chef
    - Provides free resources every 6 hours
    - Use it whenever it's available, do not allow it to cap
- Black and Gold Nucleus (black and gold orbs)
    - Used to pull weapons from the permanent weapon banner
    - Each gold pull gives you Black Gold
    - You can spend these as soon as you get them
    - If the weapon you're looking for is not in the permanent banner (pool), it might be worth it to save the nuclei
        - Every few months, a weapon from the limited banner is moved into the permanent banner so you can wait till then
- Red Nucleus (red orb)
    - Used to pull weapons from the limited weapon banner
    - Each pull gives you a Tempered Gold
    - Save and spend in batches of 120 (see Tempered Gold)
- Black Gold (gold token)
    - Used to buy a duplicate SSR weapon for 120 Black Gold
    - This means you must already own the SSR weapon
    - Save these for the 3 weapons you've chosen, especially the ones that are not good in their base form (0 star)
- Tempered Gold (red token)
    - Used to buy the limited SSR weapon in limited banner for 120 Tempered Gold
    - When the limited banner rotates to a new limited SSR weapon (once a week?) any unspent Tempered Gold will be downgraded to Black Gold
        - This is why you should only use Red Nucleus in batches of 120
    - Every account can also buy 1 Matrix Box for 50 Tempered Gold
        - This will allow you to choose any matrix
            - It's recommend you spend all your Proofs of Purchase and Special Vouchers before doing this so you can get one you don't already have
- Proof of Purchase (gold chip)
    - Used to pull matrices from the permanent matrix banner
    - Each pull gives you a Base Chip
    - If the matrix you're looking for is not in the permanent banner (pool), save up these Proofs of Purchase
        - Every few months, a matrix from the limited banner is moved into the permanent banner so you can wait till then
- Special Voucher (red chip)
    - Used to pull matrices from the limited matrix banner
    - Each pull gives you an Overclocking Chip
    - Save and spend in batches of 80 (Overclocking Chip)
- Base Chip
    - Used to buy any SSR Matrix for 80 Base Chips
- Overclocking Chip
    - Used to buy any limited SSR Matrix in limited banner for 80 Overclocking Chips
    - When the limited banner rotates to a new limited SSR matrix (once a week?) any unspent Overclocking Chips will be downgraded to Base Chips
        - This is why you should only use Special Vouchers in batches of 80
- Ability Training Points
    - Used to buy gifts from the training point shop
    - Buy Special Gifts that you can give to your weapons to unlock bonus traits
        - Some weapons might get bonus progression if you gift them one of their favored items
        - You can find the best gifts [on the database](https://toweroffantasy.info/simulacra)
- Crystal Dust
    - Used to buy items from the Crystal Dust Store
    - Buy Booster Modules and Advancement Modules

## Equipment / Armor

TODO: improve this section

- Do NOT ADVANCE individual equipment pieces unless its SSR
- You should, however ENHANCE the gear slots as it will keep the upgrades even if you change your gear
- Upgrade your gear in increments of 5 to get milestone bonuses, starting with gloves and boots
- If gear upgrade materials are limited in shop, buy it whenever it refreshes
- Don't buy blue gear, it drops from many places

## Relics

Relics are usually granted by completing a ruin for the first time. They are tools that have many uses like providing mobility, dealing damage, unlocking puzzles. It's recommended that you make a Relic set so its easy to switch between them using a hotkey (default `G`) which will let you move around more easily while traveling and add some damage to your combos while in combat.

## Cooking

Early on, it's important to prioritize unlocking all the recipes rather than making the most efficient food. This is because unlocking a recipes usually grants an achievement which rewards you with a Black Nucleus.

Some foods grant different bonuses like resistance to a specific element, while others grant increase stamina. Many of the most efficient recipes use honey, so it's important to destroy any hives you see and pickup the honey.

Here's a few recipes lists (TODO copy all of these recipes into a markdown table):

# TODO: other notes I've made that I need to organize into this guide

- Matrix guide: [https://youtu.be/7dSX0CJQfWk](https://youtu.be/7dSX0CJQfWk)
- Upgrade Mind matrix first because it grants crit which is the best stat
- Don't waste SR (purple) materials on upgrading weapons below SSR (yellow)
- Upgrade weapons above all else in this order:
    - Single target dps
    - AOE dps
    - Ranged dps
    - Healing

## Personal setup
